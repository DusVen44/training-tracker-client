Training Tracker - https://training-tracker.vercel.app/ - An app designed for athletes to track their training performances.

Why? Most currently applications are cluttered with inefficient features. I wanted to create an application that's simple, quick, and user-friendly.

Once and user signs up and logs in, they can start tracking their performances by creating a new routine. They can choose from a vast list of exercises to populate their routine. Each exercise provides and input box for the user to log their sets, reps, weight, and anything else they want to put. Once the routine is saved, it goes to their history. The user can then look back at previous routines and know what's needed to progress.

I'm using a self-built server/API to store the exercises, users, and history of routines.
